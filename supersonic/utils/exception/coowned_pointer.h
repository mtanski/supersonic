// Defines a helper 'smart pointer' class used in exception propagation. It's
// similar to linked_ptr, but w/ different release semantics: releasing does
// not set the value to NULL, and does not require that the argument is the
// last member of the linked list. Calling release() on any co-owner revokes
// ownership from all of them, transferring it to the caller. Nonetheless, after
// the release, get() continues to return the original pointer. (It is the
// responsibility of the caller of get() to ensure that the object, if
// it has been released, is still alive).
